            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>My name is Harry James Hocker and I am a professional full-stack developer.
              Having had an interest in computers since I was a child, I have used my abilities in problem-solving to
              get where I am today. During my free time, I like to mess with code and play video games. Feel free to
              contact me any time. Though I may not respond right away, I try to be friendly! My favorite food is sushi,
              and I love rainy days.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>From preschool to high school, I have moved around the United States of America many times. Starting out
              in Washington state, my place of birth, I relocated into Oregon at only the age of three. In 2002, the
              family relocated from Oregon to Pennsylvania. Finally, I moved to Florida to complete my high school
              education. </p>

            <h2>Student Ambassador</h2>
            <p>During the Summer of 2008, I was part of the People to People Student Ambassador program. During this
              program, I traveled to Greece, Italy, and France. For each visit, I was required to adapt and learn the
              basics of both the cultures and language of each location. This program taught me invaluable lessons about
              humanities and tolerance, as well as develop international social skills. Having the
              ability to experience all the different food and cultures is something I wish everyone could do!</p>

            <h2>Retail Life</h2>
            <p>For the beginning of my professional life in 2011, I worked in retail at Spencer's Gifts for about six
              years. This long-term experience in retail taught me how to bring the best customer service. Along the
              way, I learned more about myself; and I learned what I enjoyed doing. Though I had a blast working in
              retail, it was time to look for a permanent career. I left Spencer's Gifts on amicable terms to pursue a
              higher education.</p>

            <h2>College Life</h2>
            <p>To start my higher education, I studied at the St. Petersburg Community College
              in Clearwater, Florida. Some of my major accomplishments include receiving my AA with a 4.0 GPA
              and receiving honors awards from the Physical Sciences department. During my time at SPC, I worked
              in the Physical Sciences labs working with dangerous chemicals, while following proper procedures and
              instructions. Graduating with my Associates in 2019, it was time to pursue University.</p>

            <h2>University Life</h2>
            <p>UCF was my institute of choice for pursuing a Chemistry degree, but I ended up finding love in Computer
              Science. Moving from a community college to a huge university was an indescribable experience. Working
              with the top professionals in their fields, I managed to graduate in Fall 2023 with a Bachelors Degree in
              Computer Science. During my time, I pushed myself to the limit and succeeded in ways that I never thought
              possible!</p>
